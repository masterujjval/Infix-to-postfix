# Infix-to-postfix

Program to convert **infix expression** to **postfix expression**.  

**Stack** data structure has been used for the conversion of the the infix expression. for e.g ```A+B-C``` to ```AB+C-```.
It will convert convert expression as given in the above example.

In this program instead of using "Stack" library which is already available for C++, direct use of stack data structure has been used which also explains the workings of stack.
Any infix expression can be converted into a postfix expression using this conversion tool.

To run the program:
- Fork and clone the repo.
- Make sure gcc is installed in your system to run the code using terminal
